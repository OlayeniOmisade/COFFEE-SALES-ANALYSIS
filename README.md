**Business Problem**
The company is facing a substantial gender gap in coffee sales, with female customers representing only 4.97% of total purchases, compared to 95.03% for male customers. This disparity suggests a missed opportunity to increase sales among women, possibly due to a lack of targeted marketing, product variety, or engagement strategies that resonate with the female demographic. Addressing this issue could lead to significant revenue growth by appealing to and attracting more female customers.

**Methodology**
SQL, Excel, and Tableau were utilized to address the business problem and extract, analyze, and visualize the data.

•	SQL Queries: Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to extract and process data from the company’s database. Key queries answered the following questions:

5.	Total Coffee Sales by Price Range:

**Recommendations** 
1.	Target Female Customers: Implement marketing campaigns and promotions tailored specifically for female customers to address the 95% sales dominance by male customers. Consider product flavours, packaging, and advertising that appeal more to women.
2.	Replicate Successful Sales Tactics from Long Island City: Leverage the strategies used by Xena Rahim in Long Island City, where sales are the highest, across other regions to boost performance. This could involve replicating her customer engagement methods or promotional tactics.
3.	Expand Product Line with Popular Coffee Varieties: With Cappuccino and Latte leading in sales, the company can consider introducing seasonal or new variants of these popular drinks to maintain interest and drive sales further.
4.	Optimize Pricing Strategy: Since the majority of sales occur in the lower price range, the company can explore bundling options or introduce promotions for higher-priced items to encourage customers to try premium offerings.
5.	Enhance Ingredient Offering: Given the high demand for coffee and bakery ingredients, the company should expand the bakery menu and offer diverse coffee blends to attract a wider range of customers and provide more variety.
